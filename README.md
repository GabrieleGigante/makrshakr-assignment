# Makr shakr assignment
For the assignment I chose provider as a state managment solution and I didn't make the layout responsive (for the web), because after reading the requirements I assumed that it was outside of the scope of the assignment.

## Requirements

- [x] Adopt the MVVM pattern.
- [x] The items should be fetched from the following api: https://catfact.ninja/ 
- [x] The list of items should come from the /facts endpoint at the previusly linked API.

- [x] Each item can be clicked and Detail Screen should be displayed.
- [x] Detail screen must be composed by the image, and the full length title.
